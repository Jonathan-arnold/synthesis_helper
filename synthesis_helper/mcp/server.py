    - ``is_orphan``: the reaction has no EC number OR the EC is missing from

    - ``is_p450``: EC starts with ``1.14.`` — cytochrome P450 / oxygenase

      partners, often membrane-bound). Useful flag for "please give me a

    - ``n_p450`` (EC starts with ``1.14.``) — narrow P450 flag.
    - ``n_heme`` — superset of ``n_p450``: also counts peroxidases

      or products touch a curated blacklist of reactive / toxic metabolites
      (reactive aldehydes, catechol / hydroquinone, acrylate, menadione, …).
      ``toxic_intermediates`` (list of canonical names) lets the caller see
      which ones were hit.
    - ``cofactor_uses`` — dict keyed by ATP / NADH / NADPH / NAD+ / NADP+ /
      CoA / SAM; value = reaction count consuming or producing that cofactor
      in this pathway (stoichiometry-agnostic: one reaction → one count).
    - ``nadh_hint`` / ``nadph_hint`` / ``atp_hint`` — crude net balance for
      each cofactor: +1 per reaction consuming (on substrate side), -1 per
      reaction regenerating (on product side). Positive = pathway drains
      that pool. NADH and NADPH pools are biologically separate (NADPH is
      biosynthetic, scarcer) so they're reported independently.

    ``cofactor_keys`` at the top level lists every key present in each row's
    ``cofactor_uses`` dict so callers can build tabular views reliably.

    user asks to see, draw, view, graph, diagram, or visualize one pathway to
    a target chemical — there is no PNG / text-graph alternative; this is it.

    **SIDE EFFECT — READ BEFORE CALLING TWICE:** This tool WRITES an HTML
    file to the user's local ``/tmp`` and LAUNCHES their default browser,
    opening a new tab. Both actions happen on the user's machine (where
    the MCP server runs), NOT in the sandbox where your Bash / Read tools
    operate. The file path in the return value CANNOT be verified with
    Bash or Read — any such attempt will fail even though the tool
    succeeded. **Trust ``status == "opened"`` and do not re-call the tool
    to "check" or retry — every call opens a new browser tab.**

    Renders pathway #``pathway_index`` (0 = shortest / first enumerated) as a
    self-contained interactive HTML page (Cytoscape.js inlined, works offline)
    and launches the user's default browser. The page gives the user:

    - 5 layout algorithms (Layered / Breadth-first / Concentric / Force / Grid)
    - Group-by themes: shell, ec_class, role
    - Cofactor mode toggle (Inline / Shared / Hide) — defaults to Inline,
      which duplicates H2O / NAD(P)H / ATP / … next to each reaction so the
      carbon backbone stands out instead of a hairball of cofactor edges
    - Click any node to dim everything except its 1-hop neighborhood (ESC or
      background-click clears)
    - Double-click any node to copy its structured details to the clipboard
      for pasting back into Claude

    Returns a dict with ``status``, ``message``, the file path, step count,
    etc. Use ``open_cascade_interactive`` instead when the user wants the
    *full tree* of ways to make the target (branching producer graph), not
    a single linear pathway.

    Large cascades can be unwieldy — if the target has many producer
    reactions, lower ``max_producers_per_chemical`` first. ``max_reactions``
