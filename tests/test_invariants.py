"""Universal invariants for synthesize() and traceback() (cascade).

Unlike the small-cell tests (which hard-code expected shell/cascade values for
a specific topology), these tests assert **properties that must hold for any
correctly-implemented synthesize or traceback, on any input**.

The idea: teammate ships a new impl — these invariants catch bugs without
needing to know anything about the impl's internals. Each test is a formal
statement of what the algorithm means.

All tests run against the small_cell fixture (rich enough to exercise most
structural cases) plus a few minimal custom inputs for boundary cases.
